# Eventual Consistency Pattern

- is an implementation of data consistency approach
- Distributed data, stores are subject to the `Consistency`, `Availability (network)`, `Partition tolerance` `(CAP) theorem`. This is also known as Brewer's theorem. We can choose only two of these attributes.

> Distributed system system needs to be specified as having eventual consistency as an explict requirement. Eventual consistency comes from the system that exhibit scalabilit and high availability

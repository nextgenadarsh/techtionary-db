# Containers

- Piece of software in a complete file system
- Contains everything needed to run code, the runtime, system tools, and system libraries- anything that can be installed on server
- Guarantees that software will always run in the same way, regardless of its environment
- Share their host operating system and kernel with other containers on same host

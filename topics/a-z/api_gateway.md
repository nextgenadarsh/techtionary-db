# API Gateway

- Used to establish communication between microservices
- Provides simple interfaces and makes the process of consuming services simpler
- Uses high performance network to provide serious throughput
- Hides the actual APIs from clients and redirects calls to actual APIs from these clients

## API Gateway benefits for microservices

- Allows to invoke services throught API gateway
- Reduce round trips between the client and application
- Client can access different APIs in one place, as segregated by the gateway

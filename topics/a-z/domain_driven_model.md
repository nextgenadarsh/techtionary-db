# Domain Driven Model

- Main objective of domain design is to "Understand the `exact domain problems` and then drapft a model that can be written in `any language` or set of technologies".

## Characteristics

- Focus on a specific `business model`
- Reusable
- Designed so that it can be called in a loosely coupled way
- Designed `independently of persistence implementation`
- Should not be based on any infrastructure framework so that it can be pulled out from one project to another.

# Microservice Architecture

- A way to develop single application containing a set of smaller services
- Services are independent of each other and run in their own processes
- Services can be designed, developed, deployed, upgraded, tested, maintained independent of each other
- Heavily rely on interservice messaging

## Prerequisites

- Deployment and QA
- A `collaboration platform` for dev and operations team
- A `monitoring` framework

## Benefits

- `Smaller code base`
- `Independent development, deployment and scaling`
- `Scaling`
- Enhanced security options
- Independent storage options and easy changes
- `Technology independence`
- Alignment with business goals
- `Enhanced user experience` - because of minimal downtime as services are deployed independently
- `Cost benefits` - since the testing is done for smaller unit of code compared to monolith

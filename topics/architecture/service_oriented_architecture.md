# Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

## [Services](../alphabets/services.md)

## Features

- `Reusability`: multiple clients can access service
- `Stateless`: do not persist state between requests from client
- `Contract-based`: interfaces make service technology-agnostic on both sides of implementation and consumption
- `Scalability`: SOA can be individually clustered with appropriate load balancing
- `Upgradeability`: Easy to introduce new functionality or have multiple versions of same functionality
